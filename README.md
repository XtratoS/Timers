# Timers
A timers application that imitates the windows clock application, with the ability to rearrance and resize timers
# Missing Features
1. The sveltekit application needs to be optimized
1.1. Make the fonts used in local files instead of fetching from a CDN
2. Handle resizing the contents of the timer
3. Handle playing sounds when timers run out
4. Store timers in-memory so that next time the application is opened it has the same timers and layout
5. Add Night/Light modes
6. Polish how the timers look
